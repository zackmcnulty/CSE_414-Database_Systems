I thought it was kind of neat that we could upload to this database from any
personal device as long as we had the appropriate password and port.
The idea of having real time updates to this shared database is kind of
interesting. Personally, I do not really know much about how DBMSs work,
or what the cloud really is, so maybe some of the coolness of this project
was lost as me. However, being able to run stuff on Microsoft's servers rather
than my slow and old laptop was pretty neat. One thing I am curious about however
is how Microsoft maintains proper security for their databases while storing
them on the cloud, and how INSERTS and queries are properly protected. I
do not really know much about security of this fashion, but would be interested to learn.
